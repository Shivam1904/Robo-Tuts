<div data-role="header" data-theme="b" ><h3>Robots in Industry</h3></div>
	<div data-role="content">
	Modern industrial robots are true marvels of engineering.. Furthermore these robots can do that 24 hours a day for years on end with no failures whatsoever. Though they are reprogrammable, in many applications (particularly those in the auto industry) they are programmed once and then repeat that exact same task for years. Industrial robots are found in a variety of locations including the automobile and manufacturing industries. Robots cut and shape fabricated parts, assemble machinery and inspect manufactured parts. Some types of jobs robots do: load bricks, die cast, drill, fasten, forge, make glass, grind, heat treat, load/unload machines, machine parts, handle parts, measure, monitor radiation, run nuts, sort parts, clean parts, profile objects, perform quality control, rivet, sand blast, change tools and weld.

	<div data-role="header"  data-theme="b" ><h3>Intelligent Systems</h3></div>
	<div data-role="content">
	Intelligent systems is one of the new technologies with various applications. It depends mainly on making the machine capable of dealing with the surrounding elements. The applications when introduced to robots make  a new robotic generation that is capable based on certain instructions and out side effects to take the decision of moving or doing some certain actions.

	<div data-role="header"  data-theme="b"><h3>Robots in Medicine</h3></div>
	<div data-role="content">
	Robots are critical to the medical field where extreme precision and delicacy is necessary, and the margin for error slim One of the main areas of robotics applications in medicine is in surgery. This is  Because robots are able to perform major operations while only making small incisions, patients receive many benefits. Robots are used to perform heart surgery without opening patients chests. Another important area is in Prosthetics where Mechanical replacements for missing limbs and organs that can interact with the human organic system are a long-standing goal of the robotics community. Robotic devices can also provide assistance to people with severe restrictions on movement, in many cases allowing them at least some capability to move around or nearby their homes. On the other hand Rehabilitation Robots can provide exercise platforms to help restore limb function and can monitor the condition of patients undergoing rehabilitation from the effects of injuries, stroke or other brain or nerve damage.

	<div data-role="content">
	Sports and recreations is one of the main areas of robotics industry. One of the main areas of robots in to make it look like humans . those robots are called humanoid robot which  a robot with its overall appearance, based on that of the human body, allowing interaction with made-for-human tools or environments. examples of those are toys used for kids. Robots in sports are also another important issue like what is happening in soccer  fields robots .where teams used to play real matches using just robots.

	<div data-role="header"  data-theme="b"><h3>Robots in Space</h3></div>
	<div data-role="content">
	Applications outside the Earth's atmosphere are clearly a good fit for robots. It is dangerous for humans to get to space, to be in space and to return from space. Keeping robots operating reliably in space presents some unique challenges for engineers.. This is actually more of an opportunity than a challenge and leads to the possibility of some unique designs Robot  in space  can do all the work that man can not do there. It easy for manipulator to restore parts , to fix the space ship and to direct the wholes space shuttle. <br>

	<div data-role="content">
	Robotic underwater rovers are used explore and gather information about many facets of our marine environment. One example of underwater exploration is to use robots for underwater cable inspection, and for telecommunications. one of the example is the robot done by sedney university where the robot is send by itself with a mapping system and all the work is done autonomously.<br>

	<div data-role="header"  data-theme="b"><h3>Robots in Military and Security</h3></div>
	<div data-role="content">
	Some robots are used to investigate hazardous and dangerous environments. In these environments robots are used for firefighting, for entering into dangerous areas and for removing of injured persons in natural disasters. Another important applications of robots in security is for inspection and search for dangerous materials. In this robots will prevent and harms to humans operating it in case that something explodes during the inspection. Also robots are used during war for mine removal and entering into dangerous areas where robots will use guns as their manipulators.<br>
