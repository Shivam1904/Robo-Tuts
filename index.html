	<font size=6 color="red">R</font>obotics is the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, and/or cognition.<br>
	The concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century.<br><br>
	Throughout history, robotics has been often seen to mimic human behavior, and often manage tasks in a similar fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue, research, design, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. Many robots do jobs that are hazardous to people such as defusing bombs, mines and exploring shipwrecks.
	<br><br><img src="images/2.jpg" align="left" width="120" height="150">
	For many people it is a machine that imitates a human—like the androids in Star Wars, Terminator and Star Trek: The Next Generation. However much these robots capture our imagination, such robots still only inhabit Science Fiction. People still haven't been able to give a robot enough 'common sense' to reliably interact with a dynamic world. However, Rodney Brooks and his team at MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab are working on creating such humanoid robots. <br><br>
	
	<font color="red"><b>So what is a robot?</b></font><br><br>
	Well it is a system that contains sensors, control systems, manipulators, power supplies and software all working together to perform a task. Designing, building, programming and testing a robots is a combination of physics, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, structural engineering, mathematics and computing. In some cases biology, medicine, chemistry might also be involved. A study of robotics means that students are actively engaged with all of these disciplines in a deeply .</p>

<li>	The history of robots has its roots as far back as ancient myths and legends. Modern concepts were begun to be developed when the Industrial Revolution allowed the use of more complex mechanics and the subsequent introduction of electricity made it possible to power machines with small compact motors.<br><br>
	<img src="images/old2.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="130">
	After the 1920s the modern formulation of a humanoid machine was developed to the stage where it was possible to envisage human sized robots with the capacity for near human thoughts and movements, first envisaged millennia before.<br><br>
	The first uses of modern robots were in factories as industrial robots – simple fixed machines capable of manufacturing tasks which allowed production without the need for human assistance. <li><img src="images/old1.jpg" align="right" width="90" height="110">Digitally controlled industrial robots and robots making use of artificial intelligence have been built since the 1960s.

 <li>A rescue robot is what its name suggests. These types of robots assist in the aid of rescue workers. Examples of situations that would call on a rescue robot are hostages, explosions, urban disasters, etc.<br> The advantage to there robots is that humans are removed personal requirements, no fatigue and the fact that these robots are able access many places that humans aren’t able to. Since, the recent mining incidents, rescue bots have been optimized to aid in these situation .

 <li>These types of robots are automated machines capable of moving around in their environment. They are found in factory, military and security environments. They also appear in consumer products such as vacuum cleaners and blenders. Another great example of these robots is from a robot company called Kiva. They develop robots that have replaced humans in factories. Large companies including Amazon and Gap have jumped on the bandwagon. Here’s what happens when Microsoft get a hold of a mobile robot and incorporates the Kinect into a mind-blowing reality.

	<li>Autonomous robots are self supporting or in other words self contained.  In a way they rely on their own ‘brains’.<br>
    Autonomous robots run a program that give them the opportunity to decide on the action to perform depending on their surroundings.  At times these robots even learn new behavior.They start out with a short routine and adapt this routine to be more successful at the task they perform.  The most successful routine will be repeated as such their behavior is shaped.<br>Autonomous robots can learn to walk or avoid obstacles they find in their way.  Think about a six legged robot, at first the legs move ad random, after a little while the robot adjust its program and performs a pattern which enables it to move in a direction. <br>

 <li>These types of Robots are already being used in our goverment. The purpose of these Bots is to help our military during combat and other situations. The recent advancements of military robots is amazing.<br>
 There have been some developments towards developing autonomous fighter jets and bombers.The use of autonomous fighters and bombers to destroy enemy targets is especially promising because of the lack of training required for robotic pilots, autonomous planes are capable of performing maneuvers which could not otherwise be done with human pilots (due to high amount of G-Force), plane designs do not require a life support system, and a loss of a plane does not mean a loss of a pilot. However, the largest draw back to robotics is their inability to accommodate for non-standard conditions. Advances in artificial intelligence in the near future may help to rectify this.<br>

  <li>  An autonomous robot is despite its autonomous not a very clever or intelligent unit.  The memory and brain capacity is usually limited, an autonomous robot can be compared to an insect in that respect.<br>
   In case a robot needs to perform more complicated yet undetermined tasks an autonomous robot is not the right choice.Complicated tasks are still best performed by human beings with real brainpower.  A person can guide a robot by remote control.  A person can perform difficult and usually dangerous tasks without being at the spot where the tasks are performed.  To detonate a bomb it is safer to send the robot to the danger area.

		<li>Robotics is an endless-learning hobby. There are many different versions of robots you can make. From turtle bots to vehicles like the Mars rovers to rovers like R2-D2. From walkers that have anywhere from 1 to 10 legs to robotic arms to androids. Whatever you can dream, you can create.<br>
Robots are electronic devices intended to perform a desired function. Many refer to them as "machines", however, a drill press is a machine, yet it requires an operator to perform its function, where robots can be programmed to do it themselves.<br>
he level of expertise you want your robot to have and how much learning and research you want to do is up to you. For those who have relative experience in computer programming and electronics, this may come easier to you than anyone new to the hobby. Those who build models, RC vehicles, and other artwork will find it challenging to modify some of their previous projects. For those who have little or no knowledge, we will provide all the information you need to get you started, motivated, and learning what robotics is all about.Two good places to start are RobotBooks.com and Nuts & Volts Magazine. </ul>

Fixed resistors supply a resistance measured in ohms to a circuit. The higher the ohms, the more resistance. The resistor below shows how one would look like. The first bar sets the initial number (in this case, 1), the second is an assistant (add on a 5). The third bar is a multiplier (that means 15 times 100 = 1500 or 15k ohms). The final bar is the tolerance bar (meaning this resistor can vary + or - 10%).<br>

Variable Resistors</div>
<img src="images/52.jpg" height="150" width="140" border=2 align="right">
Variable resistors differ from fixed in that they either slide or rotate to adjust the resistance to where you need it for your certain project.

<div data-role="content"><div data-role="header">
Fixed and Variable Capacitors</div>

Fixed capacitors hold an electrical charge for a predetermined amount of time. The value of the capacitor is printed on the component. Smaller capacitors us a bit different system. Say it's marked with 104. That means it's a 10 with 4 zeros (104 = 100,000). Sometimes you'll see a "WV" after the voltage rating which means you can't use the capacitor with voltages exceeding this rating. You'll also find a polarity marking (- minus sign) that identifies the negative side of the capacitor and must be installed accordingly to prevent failure.<br>

Diodes</div><img src="images/57.jpg" height="150" width="140" border=2 align="right">
Diodes are made of either germanium or silicon. They carry two ratings: peak inverse voltage and current. These ratings are the maximum amount of each that a diode can handle. For instance, a 5 amp diode can only handle 5 amps before failure. They, like capacitors, have a marking (a cathode band) denoting the negative terminal. Light-emitting diodes (LED) emit infrared light, have a PIV rating of 100 to 150 volts, a maximum current rating of 40 milliamps, are powered in low-powered DC circuits of 12 volts or less, and are used with a resistor to limit the current.

Transistors</div><img src="images/58.jpg" height="150" width="140" border=2 align="right">
Transistors are divided into two catagories: signal, where they amplify a signal in things such as radios, telephones, etc., and power, where they switch a signal on or off in things such as motor drivers and power supplies. Size is usually a way to tell the two apart. Transistor are identified by a unique code, like 2N2222 or MPS6519, designating what kind of application they are for. To find this out, refer to a data book to locate the different characteristics and ratings. A signal transistor is small and can come in either a plastic or metal case. A power transistor is larger and always has a metal case to dissipate heat.

Integrated Circuits</div><img src="images/59.jpg" height="150" width="140" border=2 align="right">
<div data-role="content">
Integrated circuits are the backbone of any electronics device. They often come a dual in-line packages (DIP). Most common ICs are 8-, 14-, and 16- pin. ICs also have a unique code, such as 7400 or 4017, which you can look up in a data book to find specifications and parameters. Some contain catalog numbers and should not be confused with the code.

		The first and foremost thing to consider is the design of your electronics. This Lesson will deal with products and ideas to make your design and construction a lot more simple.
<br><h3><b><u>Solderless Breadboards</u></b></h3>
Solderless breadboards are used to experiment with your circuitry. They are not used for permanent circuits. Doing this before making a permanent circuit will allow you to change your design or improve its performance by just removing or adding a component.
<br><h3><u><b>Printed Circuit Boards</b></u></h3>
You can buy premade circuit boards, or you can make your own. Either way, once you have worked your design out on a breadboard, you can permanently build your circuit on a PCB.
<br><h3><b><u>Wire Gauge</u></b></h3>
Wire comes in different sizes. 30 AWG gauge wire is small and its maximum current capacity is 2 amps, while 12 AWG gauge wire is large and its MCC is 36 amps. The smaller the wire, the less current it will allow before overheating and burning up.
<br><h3><u><b>Eliminating Static Electricity</b></u></h3>
It has been said that your body walking across a carpet can develop a 10,000 to 50,000-volt charge. What would that do to a 5-volt component? COMPLETELY DESTROY IT! When working on your electronics, use an antistatic mat and wear low static clothes such as cotton. Store parts in antistatic pouches or tubes. Sometimes connecting an antistatic wrist strap to your wrist and the component works to eliminate static. Also, make sure your soldering iron is grounded.</li></ul>
<br>
 <ol data-role="listview" >
<li data-role="list-divider">Good Design Principles</li>
<li>Even though a device may be unplugged, there is still a small amount of current flowing in the device. A pull-up resistor between the input and the +V (positive voltage) supply or a pull-down resistor (10k for either) between the input and ground will prevent this from happening.</li>
<li>Unless instructed not to, tie unused inputs to ground to keep the circuit from going into oscillation.</li>
<li>Bypass capacitors at the +V and ground terminals of every integrated circuit will reduce noise. For this, a 10 µF capacitor will do.</li>
<li>Keeping lead lengths short by snipping them close to the solder joint will keep noise down and prevent the lead from acting like an antenna.</li>
<li>Make sure your +V and ground wires never form a loopor noise and erratic behavior will occur.</li><br>
</ol><ul data-role="listview"><li>
<p data-role="content">
<h3><b><u>Soldering Tips and Techniques</u></b></h3>
The best tip that can be given is to get yourself a good soldering "station", not just the iron. You may save yourself money by getting the whole kit. In the kit, like the ones you may find at Weller, Sears (under Tools > Electrical Shop > Soldering Tools & Accessories), or online at All-Spec, you'll find a soldering iron, an adjustable temperature base with a side tray for a sponge, the sponge, and a holder to keep your iron from burning anything. You can find these as low a $50 if you look, less at rummage sales. You need to use 0.050 inch rosin core solder only. Needle-nose pliers, wire strippers, wire cutters, and a heat sink are good tools to have. Isopropyl alcohol is a necessity to clean your components as well as your solder and iron. In case of a bad solder job or you are harvesting and you want to desolder the joints, a solder vacuum comes in handy.
As for how to solder, you may hear different ways of doing it, but the most important part is making a solid joint with just enough solder. To do this, you want to heat the joint with the iron and apply the solder. In some cases, you may not be able to hold the iron on the joint to heat it while you apply the solder. In this case, heat the joint for a second, lift, touch the solder to the joint, then the iron to the solder. In either case, use a multitester or ohm meter to make sure you made a good connection. Also, give the joint a slight tug. If it stays in tact, you've completed a solid joint. Make sure you are soldering in a well-ventilated area. Also, always wear eye protection and keep a fire extinguisher handy, just in case.

		<li>To build our first robot, we'll use 0.125 inch thick plexiglass. The idea we got from The Robot Builder's Bonanza found here. The octogon is a 6in. by 6in. base. The corners were measured and cut 2 inches in from either side. For the center holes, we used a 3/16 (#10) bit. These are 1 inch in and dead center, respectively. The holes in the sides were made with a 7/32 (#19) bit. These are 1 inch in and 1 inch apart. If you've purchased The Robot Builder's Bonanza like we did, you'll notice that they do leave out some key points to the design process. This is so you can figure out how to design or learn to design your own robots. We came up with two different alternatives as to how to finish what they started. You can use what we've done or take what we have and make your own alternatives. Either way, you can't go wrong as long as you stick to some of the key design aspects.
 The holes at the top and bottom in the middle are for the counter weights made of 1/2-inch-by-8/32 bolts, 8/32 nuts, lock washers, and capnuts. The two holes on either side are for the clamps that will hold the motors in place. These holes are only approximate locations. You may have to put them in different spaces depending on the size of your motors.</li></ul> <br>

	

 <ul data-role="listview" >
<li data-role="list-divider">Next step is to get the items you need to complete your robot :</li>
<li>2 - small hobby motors with gear reduction</li>
<li>2 - model airplane wheels</li>
<li>1 - 3 1/2-inch 10/24 all-thread rod</li>
<li>1 - four-cell AA battery holder</li>
<li>2 - double-pole, double-throw (DPDT) switches with return to center (reverse - off - forward)</li>
<li>22 gauge hookup wire</li></ul><br>
<p data-role="content"><ul data-role="listview"><li>
The rest of the design process is up to you. You can use our first design by getting a clear dome that is 6 inches in diameter. You can figure out the spacing by leaving enough space between each of the two directional switches so that none of your contacts or wires are touching.



The second design is with switch towers. Below are diagrams of how you can make your switch towers. You will have to make your own measurements according to the size switches you use. Included below is the schematic you'll need to wire everything together.

	<li>	Building robots is great fun, but just imagine a robot that can 'think' for its self. Adding a brain to your robot need not be a hard process, and will allow your robot to follow instructions and rules. Basically, robot brains come in two forms, analogue and digital.
		
		
<br><br><h2 data-role="header" align="center">Analogue Brains</h2><br>


It is possible to control your robots actuators (motors etc) using 'hard wired' circuits. By making circuits from capacitors, transistors and resistors you can make robots that can follow simple rules. For example, if they hit a wall a simple switch positioned on the front of the robot would be pressed in and the robot would be able to reverse and turn, hopefully avoiding the obstacle on its next pass.
Analogue brains have their disadvantages though. They require quite a good knowledge of electronics to design, and once they are built are very difficult to change. If you want to change the behavior of your design you will probably need to totally rebuild your analogue brain.
<br><br>Analogue circuits are generally not recommended for beginners in electronics or robotics.<br><br>
Luckily for experimental roboticists there is another option: Digital Brains<br><br>
<h2 data-role="header" align="center">Digital Brains</h2><br>
Devices called micro controllers make perfect 'brains' for robots. They are small computers on a single chip, containing their own memory and processor, and can be programmed by a PC to control your robot in any way you can imagine.
What makes micro controllers so good is that they can be re programmed again and again with just a click of a mouse. There is no need to get the soldering iron out and start messing with components like analogue circuits.
Programming these chips is fairly easy to learn, but may take a bit of patience to fully understand. Learning to program by sticking your head in a textbook and trying to memorize programs is a very slow and boring way to learn. By far the easiest way to master programming is to have a go, work through a few tutorials and try out some examples. By playing about and trying ideas you'll soon get an understanding of how programs work, and how you can write your own.

	<p data-role="content"><li>Motors are one of the most common methods used to move robots around. They can be connected to gears and wheels and are a perfect way of adding mobility to your robot. There are many types of motor, and this tutorial will cover the main ones useful for robotics.
<br>
<h2 data-role="header" align="center">DC Motors:</h2>
These are the most common and easy to use motor available. They are connected to a power supply by two wires. The direction of the motor shaft rotates can be changed by reversing the polarity (swap the positive and negative wires) of the motor supply voltage.<br>
Unfortunately motors use quite a bit of current, so you cant just plug them straight into your processor and expect them to work, the processor won't be able to supply the motor with enough current. We need to find a way of turning the motors on and off using the processor. This can be done by many methods, including transistors, relays or a motor driver chip. The Robocore contains two motor driver chips that can control up to 4 DC motors simultaneously. Connecting motors to the Robocore couldn't be simpler. Just connect the 2 wires of each motor to one of the motor outputs on the Robocore and your ready to go. The motor is controlled by 2 output pins on the processor, lets say pin 1 and pin 2. The motors direction can be changed by different outputs of the pins. See table below<br>
<table border=4 align="center">
<tr>
<td>Pin 1 <td>Pin 2 <td> Motor Output </tr>
<tr>
<td>On
<td>Off
<td>Clockwise</tr>
<tr><td>Off
<td>On
<td>Anti-Clockwise</tr>
<tr><td>Off
<td>Off
<td>Motor Off</tr>
</table>
For help programming the chip to do this have a look at the motor programming guide.
<br><h2 data-role="header" align="center">Servo Motors:</h2>

<br>
Servo motors are perfect control motors, They can be told to rotate to a specific position, making them ideal for anything that requires precision movement. Most servo motors can rotate through about 90 to 180 degrees, some rotate through a full 360 degrees. Servo's however, are unable to continually rotate, meaning they can't be used for driving wheels, but their precision movement makes them ideal for powering legs, controlling rack and pinion steering and much more.
 <br><br>
 
 
Servo motors are totally self contained. They contain a motor, gearbox and driver electronics, meaning they can be controlled directly from a microcontroller, without the need for interface electronics. The picture to the left shows the inside of a servo. You can see the gears, motor and control circuitry.<br><br>
 
Servos have 3 wires connected to them. 2 are for the power supply, usually between about 5 and 7 volts. The third wire is the control wire, which can be connected directly to the processor or micro controller (or an output of the Robocore). The position the servo rotates to can be controlled by sending pulses of electricity to the servo. Changing the delay between pulses directly controls the servos position.</p></ul>

In order to safely move around robots also need some way of understanding their world. The easiest way of doing this is to add simple sensors to you robot.<br><br>
<h2 data-role="header" align="center">Bump Sensor:</h2>
So, you've fitted some motors to your robot and its happily driving around but it probably keeps colliding with obstacles and getting stuck. You need a way for your robot to detect collisions and move around objects. Enter the humble bump sensor:<br>
A bump sensor is probably one of the easiest ways of letting your robot know it's collided with something. The simplest way to do this is to fix a micro switch to the front of your robot in a way so that when it collides the switch will get pushed in, making an electrical connection. Normally the switch will be held open by an internal spring.<br>
Micro switches are easy to connect to micro controllers because they are either off or on, making them digital. All micro controllers are digital, so this is a match made in heaven. Micro switch 'bump' sensors are easily connected to the Robocore, simply plug them into any free digital socket and away you go.<br>
The following diagram shows a typical circuit for a micro switch bump sensor. The resistor is important because it holds the signal line at ground while the switch is off. Without it the signal line is effectively 'floating' because there is nothing connected to it, and may cause unreliable readings as the processor tries to decide if the line is on or off.<br><br><br>
<br>

<h2 data-role="header" align="center">Light Sensor:</h2>
Light sensors are perfect for making your robot more interesting. With some light sensors you can make your robot follow a light, hide in the dark or even turn on some funky headlights if the light level got a bit low (under a table for example).<br>
Light sensors are basically resistors that change their value according to how much light is shining onto them.<br>
They are easy to connect to the Robocore, with a simple circuit they can be plugged straight into a free analogue socket. Getting results from them can't be simpler. Get the processor to take a reading from the socket that the sensors connected to. A high value means not much light is falling on the sensor; a low value means a lot of light is falling on the sensor.<br>

		<li>So now you've learned about how to use some electronics to make a thinking control station for your robot but you've still got the problem of building a platform to carry all of your bits around on.<br>
Have a look around our shop for some ideas about what to make your robot out of. If you're not confident about making your robot from scratch we sell a strong plastic chassis that's an ideal base for most projects.<br>
A great way of building a robot chassis is to hit the garage. Find any scrap you can and get building. It's amazing what you can do with a bit of imagination and some of the stuff you've probably got lying about. I made one of my favorite robots out of an old hard drive cage. With a bit of chopping and sawing I screwed on a couple of motors and gearboxes, fixed some wheels from an old toy car and I had a great chassis.<br>
Another good material for building robots is the famous Lego brick. It may not be the strongest material but it gives you the freedom to totally dismantle your robot and build something new. Electronics and batteries can be attached quite easily with elastic bands.<br>

		<ul data-role="listview" data-filter="true" data-filter-placeholder="search here" data-inset="true"><br><br><p data-role="content">
		<li>This is an introduction to programming using the BasicX micro controller, if you have never programmed before this will help you on your way. More experienced readers should still skim through this to get the basics of the language.<br>
Programming is a common language between you and your Robocore, it lets you tell it what to do. In robotics, programming is necessary to make machines that can work by themselves, without human intervention. These are called autonomous robots.<br><b>
1) Lets start by connecting your Robocore to the power supply and the serial port of your computer, and loading up the BasicX software.<br>
2) When this is loaded, click on the Monitor Port menu and select the COM port that the Robocore is connected to (probably COM1). The Download Port menu should be set to the same COM port.<br>
3) Click the editor button. A window should open asking for a filename. Just type a name for your first program, lets say Demoprog. It will tell you that the file does not exist, so do you want to create it. Click yes.<br></b>
Now lets write our first program!<br>
To test that the BasicX is working, we will make it send a message back to your computer. This is done using the debug.print command.<br>
Type the following program into the editor window (or copy and paste it). The first and last lines should already be present, if they are just copy the middle line.<br>
<b>Sub main()<br>
debug.print "Robocore test: Everything is working"<br>
End Sub<br></b>
Before we can download to the BasicX we need to set the chip preferences. This basically tells the chip what we want to be doing with each pin (input, output etc). To do this click on the project menu, followed by chip (or the F7 shortcut). We can leave everything as it is for now so just click on OK.<br>
Now click on the Compile menu and select Compile and Run (keyboard shortcut F5) This will send the code to the Robocore. Going back to the main BasicX window, you should see the text ' Robocore test: Everything is working ' appear on the screen.<br>
The Sub main() and End Sub commands tell the Robocore where the program begins and ends.<br>
The debug.print command is very useful for telling us what the Robocore is doing, in the next case we will see more of its capabilities<br>
Now we will make the Robocore solve an equation for us. To do this we will need a variable. This is a value stored under a name in the memory of the Robocore. We will give this variable the name ' answer '.<br><b>
Sub main()<br>
Dim answerI As integer ' declaring<br>
Dim answer As string ' variables<br>
answerI = 5*5 ' doing the maths<br>
answer=Cstr(answerI) 'convert to printable format<br>
debug.print "5 times 5 is "; answer 'print answer<br>
End Sub<br></b>
Run the program as before and you should get the computer telling you the answer.<br>
This program shows that you can print values from your program to the screen using debug.print just by adding a semi-colon and the variable name after the "text", this is very handy for example when testing sensors.<br>
The program also uses comments, these have no effect on the program but allow us to add information about each line of the program. The computer ignores everything written on the line after an apostrophe (').<br>

		<ul data-role="listview" data-filter="true" data-filter-placeholder="search here" data-inset="true"><br><br><p data-role="content">
		<li>Variables are values stored in computer memory. We need to use them for almost every program to allow the Robocore to remember things. There are various different types of values, for example strings, which are text values, and integers, which are whole number values.<br>
The computer needs you to tell it what type of value you want to use, otherwise it will get confused.<br>
Each type of variable has its uses and limitations, which is why there are simple methods for switching between variable types. This was shown in the last tutorial, lets look at that program again line by line.<br>
<b><br>
Sub main()<br>
Dim answerI As integer ' declaring<br>
Dim answer As string ' variables</b><br><br>
 
The Dim lines declare the variables, that means they set them up for use in the program. The type of variable must be specified using the ' As ' keyword. Here we have an integer and a string.<br>
<b>answerI = 5*5 ' doing the math</b><br><br>
Here the integer variable is used, this is because mathematical functions can be performed using it such as multiplication<br>
<b>answer=Cstr(answerI) 'convert to printable format</b><br><br>
Using the CStr statement the integer value held in answerI is converted into a string and held in answer, this is a text variable allowing the answer to be printed to the screen using debug.print.<br><br>
<b>debug.print "5 times 5 is "; answer 'print answer<br>
End Sub</b><br><br>
 
Variables can have nearly any name, but you cannot use words that are otherwise used in the programming language, and it is best to keep them simple, either a single letter, or a word describing what the variable does.<br><br>
Other types of variables are available. One of the types used commonly in robotics is the Boolean variable. This provides us with a true or false value.<br>
For example a bump sensor will either be pressed or not pressed, so the Boolean variable for it will either be true (pressed) or false.<br>
We set up Boolean variables using the following statement<br><br>
<b>Dim variable As Boolean.<br>
variable = true<br><br>
 </b>
Boolean logic is commonly used with conditional statements, these are covered in the next section.<br><br>
There is also the Single variable type, which allows floating point numbers e.g 2.43 or -0.66, this is occasionally useful in robotics when more maths is necessary.<br><br>

	<li>Until now our programming has been limited to running through the code once, and then the program stops functioning. This is clearly not suitable for a robot, which must be able to follow it's commands continuously for the length of time it is switched on. To do this we use loops.<br><br>
We also want our robots to make decisions based on data from its sensors, for this we need conditional statements. Loops themselves contain conditional statements in order to tell them when to run and how long to continue.<br><br>
There are several different loop commands, letting us control the function of the robot in a variety of ways.<br><br>
<h4 data-role="header" color="blue" >Do Loops:</h4><br><br>
The simple Do loop can be used to enclose your whole program, when it reaches the end of the code it returns to the beginning and starts again. We can apply this to our program used in the introduction.<br>

answerI = 5*5<br>
answer=Cstr(answerI)<br>
debug.print "The answer is "; answer<br><br>
 
Loop ' end of loop<br>
End Sub<br></b><br>
 
As you will see when you run this program, the statement is no longer displayed once, but continues to print as long as the program runs (you should press the reset button to stop it)
Now for something slightly more useful. We can add a conditional statement to the do loop by using a ' while ' statement. This lets us tell the Robocore when to stop looping.
<br><b>Sub main()<br>
 <br>
Dim answerI As integer<br>
Dim answer As string<br>
Dim i As integer<br>
i=0<br><br>
 
Do While (i < 10)<br>
answerI = 5*5<br>
answer=Cstr(answerI)<br>
debug.print "The answer is "; answer<br>
i=i+1<br>
loop<br>
 <br>
End Sub<br>
 <br>
Using the conditional statement ' while ' and a new integer variable i we have made the Robocore loop only 10 times (note that as 10 is not less than 10 the program will stop after the I = 9 loop)<br></b><br>
<h4 data-role="header" color="blue">For Loop:</h4><br><br>
We can set up the same loop using the for statement remove the Do while, Loop and i=i+1 lines and replace them with:
<br><br>Do While :  For I = 1 to 10 Step 1<br>
Loop  : Next<br><br>
The loop runs from 1 to 10 stepping up 1 each loop, this removes the need for the line I=I+1.<br>
Run the program to check that you have got it right.<br>
Now for something a little more complex, instead of just doing one sum, we can automate the Robocore to do 10 different sums for us by changing the equation to
AnswerI = I*5<br><br>
Now the Robocore takes the number of loops completed and multiplies it by five. When you run this program you should now get the answers 5,10,15 up to 50.<br><br>
<h4 data-role="header" color="blue">If Statement:</h4><br><br>
We can run a conditional statement without using a loop with an if statement. These are used as follows<br><br>
<b>Const switch as Byte = 5<br>
Sub Main()<br>
Do<br><br>
 
if (GetPin(switch)=1) then<br>
debug.print"switch pressed" <br>
call sleep(0.15)<br>
end if<br>
<br>
Loop<br>
End Sub<br><br>
 </b>
The best way to learn is to experiment, make your own program with what you've learnt and you'll soon feel more confident

		The principles of DC motors are covered in the beginner and intermediate sections of this tutorial. This section will cover the electronics needed to interface them to a Basic X microcontoller or other digital chip.<br>
The easiest way of controlling motors is using the Robocore. This board contains the driver electronics to control up to 4 DC motors or 2 stepper motors, and features direction LED's for easy debugging of circuits.<br>
However, if you want to build your own motor drivers to use in custom projects there are various methods that you can use.<br>
A circuit called an H bridge circuit will give you direction control of your DC motor. Below is the circuit diagram.<br><br>

<img src="images/a1.gif" height="150" width="140" border=2 align="right"></img ><br>
 
Here's how the circuit works.
Transistors are electronic switches, they allow you to turn on large voltages (the motor power supply) using a very small current (like the output pin of the Basic X). Each pair of transistors is connected to a pin on the micro controller and control the polarity of the current supplied to the motor. The actual components required would depend on the size of the motors that you want to use.<br>
The diodes in the circuit are very important and are called fly back diodes. They are there to prevent voltage spikes from the motors from destroying the transistors. When a motor rotates and changes direction the coils of wire inside it act as a generator and produce a current. This current is called the back electro motive force, or back E.M.F. for short. This current travels back through the circuit, in the form of powerful voltage spikes, to the transistor. Now, because transistors only allow current to flow in one direction the current hits a bottle neck as the transistor tries to stop the reverse current. If this current is particularly large, say when your reversing the direction of the motor, it will simply blow the transistor, giving your new circuit a pretty short life.<br><br>
The diodes job is to protect the transistor. It allows this back E.M.F. to bypass the transistor and travel safely back to the battery.<br>
The circuit can be powered using whatever voltage is suitable for your motors. If you are using two power supplies, one to power your Basic X and another to power your motors, you must connect the ground of each supply together or your circuit may not work properly.<br><br>
If you're looking for specific components to build the circuit the following will handle most motors up to about 12 volts.<br><br><b>

Diodes: IN4002<br>
Resistors: 2.2Kohm, 0.25 watt</b><br>

		<ul data-role="listview" data-filter="true" data-filter-placeholder="search here" data-inset="true"><br><br><p data-role="content"><li>
		
		This tutorial will look at how you can use feedback to control and regulate the speed of motors (or anything else that rotates). Let's say that you want your robot to travel at a steady speed that uses 60% power to the motors. This constant power supply would work fine on flat ground but what would happen if it encountered a hill, would it have enough power to handle a steep incline or would it slow to a crawling speed.<br><br>
This problem could be overcome with feedback. If you could somehow sense the rotational speed of the wheels you could deliver more power to the motors if they slow down (climbing a hill or overcoming an object) or apply some breaking if they are rotating too fast (travelling down hill), but always maintaining a steady speed.<br><br>
 I'm going to talk about using shaft encoder's record how fast the wheels are turning.<br>
Shaft encoders use infra red emitters and detectors that are placed fairly close to each other (about half an inch or less). When there is a direct line of sight between them the detector is 'on' and produces a voltage (normally around 1 to 3 volts). When the line of sight is blocked the detector doesn't pick up any infra red light so is 'off', producing 0 volts.<br><br>
For a perfect example of how shaft encoders work take a look inside your mouse. You will see a disk with holes around the edges. On either side of the disk are an infra red emitter and infra red detector. When you move the mouse, the mouse ball's rotation causes the perforated disk to rotate. As the disk rotates the path between the IR emitter and detector is made and broken, causing the detector to create a string of electrical pulses. By monitoring the frequency of the pulses you can deduce how far the wheel has turned and the time it took.<br><br>
 Shaft encoders for robots use exactly the same principle. A card disk similar to the one on the right can attached to the drive shaft of the wheel and used to break an IR beam between the emitter and detector.<br><br>
The diagram below shows how to connect the shaft encoder available in the components section of the Robologic shop to the Robocore. The disk rotates through the 'U' of the sensor and creates an electrical pulse at the signal line every time the IR beam is made of broken. The only external component needed is a 330 ohm resistor.<br><br>

<img src="images/a2.gif" height="150" width="140" border=2 align="right"></img ><br>
 
A good feature of using shaft encoders to monitor wheel movement is that they are totally friction free, meaning that there is no loss of drive power when they are used.<br>
If the pre-moulded 'U' design does not fit your specifications then the sensor can be constructed from separate emitter and detector components wired in the same was as above and mounted on your own design. The emitter and detector may need to be shielded with some black card or something similar to prevent them from detecting any ambient infra red.<br><br>

		As your projects gain complexity it may use many different sensors and actuators. You will need a way to effectively use all this information to produce reliable results.
There are two types of algorithm that can be used to do this. The first is called sensor fusion. This approach uses information from all of the sensors simultaneously to create a constant world model of its surroundings.<br><br>
This sort of model is very difficult to program and requires massive amounts of computational power, and so is not really suited to the world of hobby robots.<br>
This section of the tutorial will cover something called subsumption architecture. This is a way of building a simple behaviour model that is much simpler computationally based on priority.<br><br>
For this example lets say that you have built a robot that is going to follow light around the room using LDR sensors. The robot also has an ultrasound proximity sensor and bump micro switches to detect obstacles.<br>
A diagram of its subsumption architecture would look like this:<br><br>

<img src="images/a3.gif" height="150" width="140" border=2 align="right"></img ><br>
 
The diagram shows how priorities work in subsumption architecture.<br>
The bump sensor takes the highest priority, which makes sense, if your robot is stuck against a wall you don't want to be worrying about following a light source.<br>
Cruise has the lowest priority, its basically saying drive forwards until you find a light to follow (or an obstacle to avoid).<br>
The ultrasound sensor has a lower priority than the bump sensor because you ideally want to avoid objects before you collide with them.<br>

		<ul data-role="listview" data-filter="true" data-filter-placeholder="search here" data-inset="true"><br><br><p data-role="content"><li>
		One of the most powerful features of the BasicX operating system is its ability to multitask. This means it can run several tasks at the same time. It's possible to divide large programs into smaller manageable tasks that can communicate with each other.<br><br>
There is more information in the BasicX documentation about multitasking, this is a brief tutorial that aims to outline a simple implementation of multitasking and not re write the BasicX manual.<br><br>
The following sample of code simply turns the onboard red and green led's on and off but hopefully demonstrates how multitasking is implemented in the BasicX programming language.
Task 2 switches a global variable, led, between 0 and 1. Task 1 looks at the global variable and toggles the red and green led's according to its value.<br><br>
Processing time is given to other functions by calling the sleep command. We use the main procedure to call the tasks using the call task command, and then we enter an infinite loop which shares the processor time around all of the active tasks.<br><br>
dim led as byte<br>
dim stacktask1(1 to 32) as byte<br>
dim stacktask2(1 to 32) as byte<br><br>
 
sub main()<br>
calltask "task1", Stacktask1<br>
calltask "task2", Stacktask2<br><br>
 
do<br>
call sleep(2.0) 'do nothing and give all time to other tasks<br>
loop<br><br>
 
end sub<br><br>
 
sub task1()<br>
do<br>
call sleep(0.0) 'allow other tasks to run<br><br>
 
if(led=1)then 'turn on/off led<br>
call putpin(25,1)<br>
call putpin(26,0)<br>
end if<br><br>
 
if(led=0)then<br>
call putpin(25,0)<br>
call putpin(26,1)<br>
end if<br>
loop<br>
end sub<br><br>
 
sub task2()<br>
do 'Set global variable LED<br>
call sleep(1.0)<br>
led=1<br><br>
 
call sleep(1.0)<br>
led=0<br>
loop<br>
end sub<br><br>
Multitasking has some draw backs to sequential programming; mainly multitasking software generally uses more memory as each process is allocated its own stack. Also, because the processor is frequently switching tasks software can run slightly slower. However these are small limitations when compared to the powerful system of multitasking.<br>

Robots are used to perform heart surgery without opening patients chests. Another important area is in Prosthetics where Mechanical replacements for missing limbs and organs that can interact with the human organic system are a long-standing goal of the robotics community. Robotic devices can also provide assistance to people with severe restrictions on movement, in many cases allowing them at least some capability to move around or nearby their homes. On the other hand Rehabilitation Robots can provide exercise platforms to help restore limb function and can monitor the condition of patients undergoing rehabilitation from the effects of injuries, stroke or other brain or nerve damage.
