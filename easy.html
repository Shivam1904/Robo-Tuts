		<p data-role="content"> 
		Robotics is an endless-learning hobby. There are many different versions of robots you can make. From turtle bots to vehicles like the Mars rovers to rovers like R2-D2. From walkers that have anywhere from 1 to 10 legs to robotic arms to androids. Whatever you can dream, you can create.<br>
Robots are electronic devices intended to perform a desired function. Many refer to them as "machines", however, a drill press is a machine, yet it requires an operator to perform its function, where robots can be programmed to do it themselves.<br>
he level of expertise you want your robot to have and how much learning and research you want to do is up to you. For those who have relative experience in computer programming and electronics, this may come easier to you than anyone new to the hobby. Those who build models, RC vehicles, and other artwork will find it challenging to modify some of their previous projects. For those who have little or no knowledge, we will provide all the information you need to get you started, motivated, and learning what robotics is all about. Two good places to start are RobotBooks.com and Nuts & Volts Magazine.

		Components are the electronic parts that make your robot think, act, and search for what you program it to do.<br>
<div data-role="content"><h3>Fixed Resistors</h3><img src="images//l51.gif" height="150" width="140" border=2 align="right">

Fixed resistors supply a resistance measured in ohms to a circuit. The higher the ohms, the more resistance. The resistor below shows how one would look like. The first bar sets the initial number (in this case, 1), the second is an assistant (add on a 5). The third bar is a multiplier (that means 15 times 100 = 1500 or 15k ohms). The final bar is the tolerance bar (meaning this resistor can vary + or - 10%).<br>

<br>
</div>



<div data-role="content">
<h3>Variable Resistors</h3>
<img src="images//52.jpg" height="150" width="140" border=2 align="right">
Variable resistors differ from fixed in that they either slide or rotate to adjust the resistance to where you need it for your certain project.
<br>
</div>

<div data-role="content">
<h3>Fixed and Variable Capacitors</h3>

Fixed capacitors hold an electrical charge for a predetermined amount of time. The value of the capacitor is printed on the component. Smaller capacitors us a bit different system. Say it's marked with 104. That means it's a 10 with 4 zeros (104 = 100,000). Sometimes you'll see a "WV" after the voltage rating which means you can't use the capacitor with voltages exceeding this rating. You'll also find a polarity marking (- minus sign) that identifies the negative side of the capacitor and must be installed accordingly to prevent failure.<br>

<div data-role="content">
<h3>Diodes</h3><img src="images//57.jpg" height="150" width="140" border=2 align="right">
Diodes are made of either germanium or silicon. They carry two ratings: peak inverse voltage and current. These ratings are the maximum amount of each that a diode can handle. For instance, a 5 amp diode can only handle 5 amps before failure. They, like capacitors, have a marking (a cathode band) denoting the negative terminal. Light-emitting diodes (LED) emit infrared light, have a PIV rating of 100 to 150 volts, a maximum current rating of 40 milliamps, are powered in low-powered DC circuits of 12 volts or less, and are used with a resistor to limit the current.
</div>
<br>
<div data-role="content">
<h3>Transistors</h3><img src="images//58.jpg" height="150" width="140" border=2 align="right">
Transistors are divided into two catagories: signal, where they amplify a signal in things such as radios, telephones, etc., and power, where they switch a signal on or off in things such as motor drivers and power supplies. Size is usually a way to tell the two apart. Transistor are identified by a unique code, like 2N2222 or MPS6519, designating what kind of application they are for. To find this out, refer to a data book to locate the different characteristics and ratings. A signal transistor is small and can come in either a plastic or metal case. A power transistor is larger and always has a metal case to dissipate heat.
</div>

<br>
<div data-role="content">
<h3>Integrated Circuits</h3><img src="images//59.jpg" height="150" width="140" border=2 align="right">
Integrated circuits are the backbone of any electronics device. They often come a dual in-line packages (DIP). Most common ICs are 8-, 14-, and 16- pin. ICs also have a unique code, such as 7400 or 4017, which you can look up in a data book to find specifications and parameters. Some contain catalog numbers and should not be confused with the code.

		<h1 data-role="header">Lesson 5: Electronic design and construction</h1>
		<p data-role="content"> 
		The first and foremost thing to consider is the design of your electronics. This lesson will deal with products and ideas to make your design and construction a lot more simple.
<br><h3><b><u>Solderless Breadboards</u></b></h3>
Solderless breadboards are used to experiment with your circuitry. They are not used for permanent circuits. Doing this before making a permanent circuit will allow you to change your design or improve its performance by just removing or adding a component.
<br><h3><u><b>Printed Circuit Boards</b></u></h3>
You can buy premade circuit boards, or you can make your own. Either way, once you have worked your design out on a breadboard, you can permanently build your circuit on a PCB.
<br><h3><b><u>Wire Gauge</u></b></h3>
Wire comes in different sizes. 30 AWG gauge wire is small and its maximum current capacity is 2 amps, while 12 AWG gauge wire is large and its MCC is 36 amps. The smaller the wire, the less current it will allow before overheating and burning up.
<br><h3><u><b>Eliminating Static Electricity</b></u></h3>
It has been said that your body walking across a carpet can develop a 10,000 to 50,000-volt charge. What would that do to a 5-volt component? COMPLETELY DESTROY IT! When working on your electronics, use an antistatic mat and wear low static clothes such as cotton. Store parts in antistatic pouches or tubes. Sometimes connecting an antistatic wrist strap to your wrist and the component works to eliminate static. Also, make sure your soldering iron is grounded.

<ul data-role="listview">
<li data-role="list-divider">Good Design Principles</li>
<li>Even though a device may be unplugged, there is still a small amount of current flowing in the device. A pull-up resistor between the input and the +V (positive voltage) supply or a pull-down resistor (10k for either) between the input and ground will prevent this from happening.</li>
<li>Unless instructed not to, tie unused inputs to ground to keep the circuit from going into oscillation.</li>
<li>Bypass capacitors at the +V and ground terminals of every integrated circuit will reduce noise. For this, a 10 µF capacitor will do.</li>
<li>Keeping lead lengths short by snipping them close to the solder joint will keep noise down and prevent the lead from acting like an antenna.</li>
<li>Make sure your +V and ground wires never form a loopor noise and erratic behavior will occur.</li>
</ul>
<p data-role="content">
<br><h3><b><u>Soldering Tips and Techniques</u></b></h3>
The best tip that can be given is to get yourself a good soldering "station", not just the iron. You may save yourself money by getting the whole kit. In the kit, like the ones you may find at Weller, Sears (under Tools > Electrical Shop > Soldering Tools & Accessories), or online at All-Spec, you'll find a soldering iron, an adjustable temperature base with a side tray for a sponge, the sponge, and a holder to keep your iron from burning anything. You can find these as low a $50 if you look, less at rummage sales. You need to use 0.050 inch rosin core solder only. Needle-nose pliers, wire strippers, wire cutters, and a heat sink are good tools to have. Isopropyl alcohol is a necessity to clean your components as well as your solder and iron. In case of a bad solder job or you are harvesting and you want to desolder the joints, a solder vacuum comes in handy.
As for how to solder, you may hear different ways of doing it, but the most important part is making a solid joint with just enough solder. To do this, you want to heat the joint with the iron and apply the solder. In some cases, you may not be able to hold the iron on the joint to heat it while you apply the solder. In this case, heat the joint for a second, lift, touch the solder to the joint, then the iron to the solder. In either case, use a multitester or ohm meter to make sure you made a good connection. Also, give the joint a slight tug. If it stays in tact, you've completed a solid joint. Make sure you are soldering in a well-ventilated area. Also, always wear eye protection and keep a fire extinguisher handy, just in case.

		To build our first robot, we'll use 0.125 inch thick plexiglass. The idea we got from The Robot Builder's Bonanza found here. The octogon is a 6in. by 6in. base. The corners were measured and cut 2 inches in from either side. For the center holes, we used a 3/16 (#10) bit. These are 1 inch in and dead center, respectively. The holes in the sides were made with a 7/32 (#19) bit. These are 1 inch in and 1 inch apart. If you've purchased The Robot Builder's Bonanza like we did, you'll notice that they do leave out some key points to the design process. This is so you can figure out how to design or learn to design your own robots. We came up with two different alternatives as to how to finish what they started. You can use what we've done or take what we have and make your own alternatives. Either way, you can't go wrong as long as you stick to some of the key design aspects.</p>
<p data-role="content"> The holes at the top and bottom in the middle are for the counter weights made of 1/2-inch-by-8/32 bolts, 8/32 nuts, lock washers, and capnuts. The two holes on either side are for the clamps that will hold the motors in place. These holes are only approximate locations. You may have to put them in different spaces depending on the size of your motors.</p>

	

<ul data-role="listview">
<li data-role="list-divider">Next step is to get the items you need to complete your robot :</li>
<li>2 - small hobby motors with gear reduction</li>
<li>2 - model airplane wheels</li>
<li>1 - 3 1/2-inch 10/24 all-thread rod</li>
<li>1 - four-cell AA battery holder</li>
<li>2 - double-pole, double-throw (DPDT) switches with return to center (reverse - off - forward)</li>
<li>22 gauge hookup wire</li></ul>
<p data-role="content">
The rest of the design process is up to you. You can use our first design by getting a clear dome that is 6 inches in diameter. You can figure out the spacing by leaving enough space between each of the two directional switches so that none of your contacts or wires are touching.

</p>
<p data-role="content">
The second design is with switch towers. Below are diagrams of how you can make your switch towers. You will have to make your own measurements according to the size switches you use. Included below is the schematic you'll need to wire everything together.
